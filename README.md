## Problem Statement

Employee attrition is a significant concern for organizations due to the associated costs and disruptions. This project explores key factors influencing attrition and employs predictive modeling techniques to understand and predict employee departures.

## Steps Followed in this Project

- Downloaded and transformed the dataset in Excel for better data understanding.
- Imported the Excel file into Power BI.
- Created essential measures and conditional columns for visualizations.
- Classified and segmented attrition based on age, education, satisfaction rate, and more.
